CppUtils
========

CppUtils shall become a collection of useful functions that I need for other projects. It is yet to be decided if it will
be a header only library since it will consist mainly of templates.

Some features I plan to implement:

* Base conversion and lexical casts
* (PSOIX) socket abstraction layer
* Crypto stuff (encryption, hashes, ...) using libcrypto, just object oriented
 
CppUtils is under active development and comes without any guarantees.
